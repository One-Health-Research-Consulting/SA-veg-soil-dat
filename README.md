A phytosociology and descriptive study of wetland vegetation and ecology, soils and 
precipitation in the breeding habitat of floodwater Aedes, known Rift Valley fever 
virus vectors, in South African pans. **PLoS One.**

This repository contains the soil and vegetation data described in the study.

## The Vegetation Data
There are four data sets in the vegetation data. 

 - Appendix A Syntaxonomic Table 2025.xlsx
 - Appendix B RVFP-Plant indetifications + authors names.xlsx
 - Clean Y3 Line Point Veg Data.csv
 - Line Point species names.csv
 
 Appendix A and B are listed as supplementary information. It was decided that it would 
 be best to store these data in an appropriate data repository, rather than in the 
 supplemental information.
 
 The line point data from 2017 is also provided and this data was used to make 
 Figures 5 and 6. The code to make the two figures is also included in the repo: 
 Line point analysis.R.
 
## The Soil Data
The data collected through the study at the 22 sites (some sites had two pans and 
in this case, both pans were sampled for separate soil analyses). The soil data "
FS soil data 2018 - Gqalaqha.xlsx." This is the official publication of the data 
collected and analyzed in the Masters' thesis "Identifying wetland soil properties 
aiding the dormancy of Rift Valley fever vectors in central South Africa" by Zikhona 
Gqalaqha at the [University of the Free State (2020).](https://scholar.ufs.ac.za/items/c4e90abf-23ed-4e81-99e8-7f946055b8e0).

There are three tabs in the Excel file: "Soil Data" provides the chemical, texture 
and classification data for all soil horizons; "Top soils" provides the select measurements
only for the first layer; "Index of abbreviations" defines the codes used for Farm ID, 
soil form, layers and treatment.

As indicated in the publication, all of the data collected and presented in this 
repository was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction 
Agency. The content of the information does not necessarily reflect the position or 
the policy of the federal government, and no official endorsement should be inferred.
